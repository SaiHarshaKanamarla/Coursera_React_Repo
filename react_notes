firstly, we need to create a react app..so we need to install a module called create-react-app from npm, this can be done using the following command

npm install create-react-app

Then, to create the actual application, we need to then execute

create-react-app "application_name"

In react, during styling, all the elements are names using className instead of class as in HTML because the class is a keyword that is used in ES6. So 
to prevent any confusion, class in styling is renamed as className.

JSX - JavaScript Extensions.

const element = <h1> Hello, World </h1>;

JSX is the syntactic extension to javascript. It is a shorthand notation to represent javascript function calls that evaluate to javascript objects.
React combines both UI and rendering logic.
